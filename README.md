# About
This is a project in which I have implemented a [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) classifier for a dataset on two strains of the Iris plant:  
* [Iris setosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_setosa)  
* [Iris versicolor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_versicolor)  
I have used data by [Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data) and applied needed changes.  
Iris setosa has been described as +1 and Iris versicolor as -1 in order for Perceptron to be able to classify between the two.  
I also made this in JavaScript as an attempt to strengthen my knowledge of JavaScript Async/Await abilities.
# How to run
To run you need to have Node.js installed on your device. Then while in the directory of the project run `node ./perceptron.js`
